OVERALL

We placed all image results in a3/raytracer/images

Everything was completed for Part A
However, Part B was mostly partially completed.


CODE STRUCTURE

We combined the code for both Part A and Part B

So in util.h we set booleans for each individual feature to be on or off
Raytracer does nothing if we combine multiple? Some error on our features?
Basically turn individual bools to true or false.

Then in main.cpp we set up multiple different scenes to run.
There is a scene_number var and 0 is default, 1 is sphere tex, and 2 is cylinder.
Other than than we just run AA and shadows with default scene.

So, Part A is just running default scene with all bools in util false.


IMPLEMENTATION

For Part B, we implemented (or tried to) the following:

- hard/soft shadows
- reflection/refraction
- antialiasing
- texturing
- other shapes (a cyclinder)

The results are in the images folder under a3/raytracer


SOURCES

All the sources should be noted here, if we missed any we also wrote the source down in the code where we referenced them.

ROLES

We split up the work and we helped each other debug our code.
