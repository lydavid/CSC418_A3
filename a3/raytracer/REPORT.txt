OVERALL

We placed all image results in a3/raytracer/images

Everything was completed for Part A
However, Part B was mostly partially completed.

In images folder, part A imgs are named as required.
As for part B our attempts:

AAview1/AAview2 is for antialiasing
CYCLINDERview1/2 is for cyclinder
TEX_SPHEREview1/2 is for texure
view1_HS1/2 and view2_HS1/2 is for shadows


CODE STRUCTURE

We combined the code for both Part A and Part B

So in util.h we set booleans for each individual feature to be on or off
Raytracer does nothing if we combine multiple? Some error on our features?
Basically turn individual bools to true or false. Util.h is in make file
but when we modify util.h and call make it doesn't recompile, so we need
to change a main file and util bool then recompile.

Then in main.cpp we set up multiple different scenes to run.
There is a scene_number var and 0 is default, 1 is sphere tex, and 2 is cylinder.
Other than than we just run AA and shadows with default scene.

So, Part A is just running default scene with all bools in util false.

The code for antialiasing is in Raytracer::render function in raytracer.cpp
Commented out the part where antialiasing is coded


The code for cyclinder is in scene_object.cpp and we made a new UnitCylinder::intersect
function for the cylinder.

Code for shadows is in light_source.cpp and raytracer.cpp (shadeRay function). Also code
for reflection is in this function too.

Code for texure is mainly in scene_object.cpp in UniSphere function for sphere texturing,
made some unkwnown edits that causing seg faults and errors. The other code for texturing
is in raytracer.cpp of shadeRay function. What we had working is shown in the images folder.

IMPLEMENTATION

For Part B, we implemented (or tried to) the following:

- hard/soft shadows
- reflection/refraction
- antialiasing
- texturing
- other shapes (a cyclinder)

The results are in the images folder under a3/raytracer

All the sources should be noted here, if we missed any we also wrote the source down in the code where we referenced them.

ROLES

We split up the work and we helped each other debug our code.
